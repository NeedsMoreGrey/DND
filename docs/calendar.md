# Calendar
The calendar year of Endur is broken down into spans, lents, and seasons.
### Days and Nights
The sun neither rises nor sets, but instead appears to wax and wane over the course of the day. Every year peaks in Alburn, when the sun never wanes, and ends in darkness during the season of the Evernight when not even a thin sliver of sun shines.
