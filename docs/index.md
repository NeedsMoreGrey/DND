# Welcome to Endur

Demi Gods rule in the stead of the Two-Faced Gods that came before them. They are capricious, arrogant, and occasionally prone to visit. 

Endur is a large, high-magic, low-tech, everchanging world. The world is in a renaissance and people are calling it the Prosperous Age, recovering from times that even the Demi Gods refuse to speak of. 

Towns are growing, travel is the safest its been in memory, and the world is expanding as it seeks to learn the mysteries of its own land. 

What is the wandering mist? Where did the giant rends in the earth come from? What is in the Maelstrom? Why are Elven lifespans getting shorter? Who shattered the moon? There is so much that we do not know.

So much knowledge has been forgotten. More still has been lost after the Dead Age. The landscapes are peppered with Ancient buildings, harking from times long past. 

The sun waxes and wanes over the course of a day. The stars are unchanging. And the moon is shattered, though it moves together as though it is still one, turning a lazy arc moonwards (counter-clockwise), dipping below and rising above the horizon.

So much is unknown. Is there more out there? More world to explore? More islands? Those that have sailed west from Cianth of Valis either come back with no memory of their trip and bumping up against an unexpected shore, their rations gone. More simply haven't come back at all. The same is true of those that set off East from Kern or Damor.

A slender handful of sailors claim to have seen the edge of the world, to have gazed out at the stars from the edge of the world. Other claims to have only seen mist, deep and impenetrable. Meanwhile all sailors talk of the Maelstrom. It is a fear that unites them all that they might be trapped in their currents and pulled down to the depths of the ocean, never to return. 

And yet, Endur is a beautiful world. From the verdant plains of Adriga to the wild forests of the Aeld, it is wonderous. Llorim is filled with strange artefacts for those brave enough to go in search of them. Sehlia is harsh but beautiful. Aszea is filled with nomads and Maeli.
