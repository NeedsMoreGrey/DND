# Ailur
Ailur is a relatively calm island located to to the east of the Aeld (Continent). It has a temperate climate and is one of the calmest countries on Endur. The capital is Ankur, a port town located on the west coast, providing easy trade with Furl, Kern, Ostur, Adriga, Damor and Llorim. 

Each town has its own local governments which are often mostly filled by local nobility. While there is an overarching government, it is mostly regarded as benignly useless and councils are mostly left to do their own thing with the taxes they raise. 

A source of contention, however, is the the relationship with the Aeld, a much larger country that is primarily run by Fae-descended creatures. As the lives of Elves have steadily decreased, the search has been directed both inwards and outwards with little success and much turmoil. 

Ailur has seen more adventuring parties from the Aeld and the Ath'relin Institute of Mastery has been training more Elves in recent decades. There is a lot of sympathy for the Elves, but the view by some has soured as a loud minority of Elves have treated access to anything that may aid their quest as their right, not a privilege shared with them by those that want to help.
