# Customs
There are many customs on Endur, here are some of the most common.

## Customs by Half
Due to the worship of Demi Gods there is a significance to things that are made to be halved. Bread is often made to be broken in two (called Demibread) as a part of social and religious rituals, and the same goes for currency. Notably, simply breaking anything in half is not considered polite. 

All currency can be broken in half. The larger the denomination, the stronger the theoretical binding. Depending where you are in the world, partaking in these customs may invoke some of the Fae magic and compel people to honour them. 
#### Half Penny Bargains
Half penny bargains are deals made between two people in a tavern in front of many folk. A penny is literally broken to symbolise the bargain. Half penny bargains are binding in the eyes of the law and it is considered extremely bad luck to break one. 
#### Half Penny Debts
When a major debt is owed people will break a currency in half and will wear the broken piece around their neck, using the hole in the currency to wear them. 
#### Half Penny Tithes
People break a penny in half and throw it to the church to absolve them of their sins, then through the other in as a "donation", which are then re-united later by the priest. The church makes a lot of money this way. 

#### Shortchange
The custom when you owe someone is to give them some “short” change, you give them half a penny as downpayment on the debt you intend to settle.

#### Mending Pennies
Upon the completion of a bargain, debt, etc, a local priest, banker, or particularly accomplished tavern master may perform the mending cantrip to symbolise the completion of the task.
