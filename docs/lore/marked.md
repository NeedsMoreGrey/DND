# The Marked
No one knows what causes someone to gain a Mark. There are benefits and downsides to being Marked. They are stronger, faster, more resilliant. The Marked can use magic, can be healed, and even brought back from the dead. While trained professionals can become strong, the Marked get stronger faster. 


However, the Marked are also said to be cursed. That monsters are drawn to them. Some of them simply disappear. And few of the Marked's eulogies end with "And they died peacefully in their sleep", though that isn't to say that doesn't happen. 

### Choose Your Mark
When you design your character, choose a mark from the table below or talk to me to create your own. Marks distinguish you from others and while they can be concealed, it is with some difficulty and even then a careful observer may spot it unless concealed with the use of a spell.
