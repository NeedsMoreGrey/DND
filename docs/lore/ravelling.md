#Raveling
Ravelling is the main sport of Ailur. It is a spectator sport where a team of five completes a mini-dungeon, trying to complete as much of the dungeon as possible before the teams clash in the center in a brawl. At entry level, a Ravel consists of three phases, though pro-ravelling often consists of more phases and more teams to increase the difficulty. 

Live weapons are not allowed and ravellers are given equivalent weapons. Ravellers are also given shields which protect them against the supplied weapons.

Teams start with points which they lose as they fail to complete tasks or lose the temporary hit points they have received. When all their temporary hit points are gone, they are out of the Ravel and cannot contribute anymore. When the time limit expires or all of the team are eliminated, the ravel ends. 

At entry level, teams start with 25 points. You lose points when you fail a check or saving throw, when you faily to kill a monster within a time limit, when you lose half your temporary hitpoints, and when you lose all your temporary hitpoints.

## The Entrance
This phase usually involves killing minor monsters while clearing a path into the dungeon. 

This typically requires perception checks, dexterity checks, wisdom check, and attack rolls.

## The Dungeon
This phase involves solving puzzles and avoiding traps.

This typically involves dexterity, strength, and consistution saving throws, strength, dexterity, wisdom, and intelligence checks, but sometimes charisma perssuasion/deception checks can sometimes help reduce the number of checks needed to be made. Some failed checks may spawn monsters.

## The Clash
The teams clash in the center. This is usually a battle royale, however the clash can sometimes involve complications such as environmental hazards, monsters, or additional objectives. Some objectives may be an opportunity to gain points. Other objectives may incur penalties if they are not completed, even if a team is eliminated.
