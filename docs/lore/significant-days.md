# Days of Significance
Regions have their own practices and days of significance, some celebrating heroes, others their own customs. But there are some days which are universally significant on Endur.
#### Firstlight
After Evernight breaks people hold a Firstlight Festival to celebrate the reappearance of the sun, drinking spiced wines, eating food, and generally making merry.
#### The Festival of Calor
A festival in which people dress in their personality's colour. Towns are often daubed in bright colours, people will dye their hair, and paint their faces. There is music, dancing, and merriment.
#### The Solemn Walk
Just as life is a journey, so is death. People will journey to a neighbouring village or town to signify the journey they will make after death and pray to Zarus to take care of their friends and family who have passed before them. Followers of Zarus will fast and perform acts of service to those who are old or sick. those that have been revived visit a church and pay a tithe to thank Zarus for guarding them during death and releasing them back to this world.
