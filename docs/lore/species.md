### Species
There are no species restrictions, and if you want to make a custom species that is a possibility. However there are some non-mechanical changes due to the changes in origins and backstory. 

For example, in classic D&D Elves live for about 750 years, but in Endur they live for about 200 years and are also known as the Aeli. Dragonborn were created by the Dragons as slaves in a long forgotten age. 

Animal races (such as Harengon, Owlin, Kenku, etc) are sub-species of the Maeli and were created by Fae magic. When you select your species you may contact me for additional background lore if you are interested as much of it differs from Faerun.
