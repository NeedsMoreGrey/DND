### Species
There are no species restrictions, and if you want to make a custom species that is a possibility. However there are some non-mechanical changes due to the changes in origins and backstory. 

For example, in classic D&D Elves live for about 750 years, but in Endur they live for about 200 years and are also known as the Aeli. Dragonborn were created by the Dragons as slaves in a long forgotten age. 

Animal races (such as Harengon, Owlin, Kenku, etc) are sub-species of the Maeli and were created by Fae magic. When you select your species you may contact me for additional background lore if you are interested as much of it differs from Faerun. 

## Aasimar
Somewhere in their lineage, by pact, romance or otherwise Aasimar have the blood of the Demi Gods in them. Aasimar traits often skip multiple generations and often come as a surprise to their parents. Often their heritage becomes apparent during puberty.

## Goliaths
Goliaths are seemingly all that remain of the Giant races, if one believes in such things. While most commit stories to paper, Goliath commit them to their skin in the language of their ancestors. The saying "We are our actions" is one that is repeated by every Goliath family.

## Maeli
During the height of the fae times they wove magic into many creatures, infusing them with intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Thus it is known that all animal creatures, from the tabaxi, to the owlkin, to the loxodon, are all maeli. 

## Tieflings
Tieflings were once said to be of The Below, a terrifying place from which horrifying creatures would sometimes crawl from to rampage and destroy. But such views are archaic and a contemporary historian would say that they were the other side of the coin of the fae, where dark deals were signed in blood, not words. But today, most would ssay the fire that runs through them was that of deep instinctual passion and their cultural distaste for being betrayed.
