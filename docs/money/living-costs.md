# Living Costs
In the last campaign I ran money was plentiful but there were few ways to spend it, so acquiring currency was rarely interesting or meaningful. During the campaign money is going to be spent on simply living, as well as various materials. 

To help root the world and to help you understand the value of the money you gain and spend, this table gives you an idea of how much each lifestyle would cost for a day and a year. It also helps me to set the amount of money people are likely to have on them more easily and the reward translates directly to player benefits.

## Life on the Road
### Staying in Towns
When you are outside your usual living space and staying at inns, taverns, etc you may incur additional costs as you will not be able to prepare your own food and rent may be higher, unless you live a wretched/squalid lifestyle wherer food may be begged for and no accomodation is used.

| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     | Cost Per Year |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Wretched     | 1 cp          | 50 sp         |
| Squalid      | 1 sp          | 50 gp         |
| Poor         | 4 sp          | 200 gp        |
| Modest       | 2 gp          | 1000 gp        |
| Comfortable  | 4 gp          | 2,000 gp      |
| Wealthy      | 8 gp          | 4,000 gp      |
| Aristocratic | 20 gp minimum | 10,000 gp      |

### Tavelling, Rations, and Foraging
Basic rations for travelling cost 5 silver per day, however foraging is possible in many locations. Foraging only finds enough food for yourself.


#### Foraging DCs
| Food Availability    | Check DC     |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Abundant food and water sources     | 10          |
| Limited food and water sources      | 15          |
| Very little, if any, food and water sources         | 20          |

If you are proficient at foraging (e.g. if you have the outlander background), these DCs are lowered by 5 and will provide enough food for up to 5 people. 

## Recurring Costs
You will need to spend money as time passes. If you choose to live modestly at the Institute for a [span](/calendar) (12 days), you will need to spend 12 gp to do so. similarly, if you travel from Heresborough to Theresham and the journey takes a span (12 days), you will need to pay 24 gp to travel modestly.  

However, instead of trying to plan ahead and manage resources such as ration, you will instead pay *after* the time has been completed to save on excessive micromanaging.
