# Gods
Much knowledge has been lost in upheavals that pitted immortals against one another. 
The despised Two-Faced Gods are gone, dead or fled, and the Demi-Gods stand in their place. 

Often arrogant, sometimes wild, and altogether unpredictable, Demi-Gods grant boon and bane as they see fit.

But as the saying goes, half a God is better than One. So instead it is to the House Gods that many people turn, Minor Gods that give small blessings to their followers.

## Choosing a God
If you are playing a character that may follow a God, Demi-Gods are plentiful, but Minor Gods can be even more Personal.  

## Demi-Gods 
Demi-Gods have a slightly Greek-mythology flavour. They can go from loving you to hating you at the drop of a hat. Demi-Gods visit the world from time to time, sometimes even in pairs. From Anora (the Demi-God of Health), to Sidian (the Demi-God of the Dark), many serve the Demi-Gods to support them and gain their favour. You may choose from the table below or talk to me to create a Demi God that suits your character.

## Minor Gods
Minor Gods do not have the power that Demi-Gods can boast of, but they are perfect for choosing a highly personal God to serve. Often called "House Gods", they are the Gods of things such as The Breeze, Warm Hearths, Baking, Refreshing Drinks, Petty Spite, Minor Discomforts, and more.
