# Religion
There was a time before Demi Gods. When true gods walked the world, shaping it as they pleased during the Age of creation. What happened that they would turn on their creation is unknown. 

#### The Book of Betrayal
Religious literature is a confusing mess on Endur. The Demi Gods have told many stories, made many edicts, but leave much interpretation up to their followers. Different priests and clerics who claim to have a direct connection with their Demi Gods may give wildly different proclamations. But there is one book on which Endur which all churches carry. The Book of Betrayal.

The Book speaks of times before the Dead Age. It details how the Demi Gods were betrayed of the Two Faced Gods, of their fight to protect the people of Endur and how much the Demi Gods sacrificed in that fight. 

However, dedicated religious scholars often find themselves in heated debates about the timeline of these solemn stories, with little clarification from the Demi Gods themselves. Some fringe scholars question the veracity of some claims. That the Demi Gods fought only for their own survival, not the people they claim to protect.

But few refute the scars left on the world by the clash between the Demi Gods and the Two Faced betrayers. From the Pit of Tierce to the Rend of Sehlia, the toll can be viewed by any that dare to make the journey.
#### Churches
Churches are always for all religions. While a priest or cleric that runs a church may have a chosen Demi-God or Minor god, there are too many Demi Gods and Minor Gods to allocate spaces for eachâ€”and so they are shared.
#### The Marked Halls
People with a Marking often have a private place to pray in larger churches as they are more likely to be able to commune with the Demi Gods and Two Faced Gods.
#### Calor
One of the more popular gods is Calor, Demi God of colour. Wherever Calor would go, beauty would often follow. Those that have met him said that even their clothes matched them better after being in his presence. During a visit, he once said that that everybody has their own "colour" that he could see, like an aura that matched their personality. 

Followers of Calor often wear the colour they believe their aura is and will see priests to get personality readings, especially when they aren't feeling themselves and are "off colour". It is considered good luck for people to get their auras read by a priest of Calor before they get married, believing that people whose auras complimented or matched each other were destined for a happy marriage.
