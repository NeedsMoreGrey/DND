# Downtime 
Downtime takes place in "turns". you will be given a certain amount of Downtime Turns to spend. **A downtime turn takes 3 days.** Unless stated otherwise, a downtime turn gives you the benefits of a long rest.

## Downtime Activities
#### Freetime
You do not spend the entirety of a downtime on a singular thing and will have freetime during your activities. Freetime does not consume a downtime turn.
- Basic character interactions (e.g. having conversations, writing letters, etc)
- Copying spell scrolls
- Carousing *(Prevents resting)*
- Gambling
- Research 
- Ravelling *(Prevents resting)*
#### Personal research
Attempt to learn things related to your current quests, situation, or the history of the world. This can include going to the library, going to taverns and talking to the locals, etc. Research conducted at AIM will reduce the DC by 5.
#### General Work
Earn your keep by working. General work earns you 4 GR per day.
#### Trading
If you do not participate in trading, items can only sold at 50% of base value while in any major town. Trading you can sell an item for 75% of its base value as you take the time to find the appropriate merchant. Each downtime turn gives you 10 Trading Points to distribute amongst the items you have to sell. 
##### Selling
If you engage in trading you can sell an item for 75% of its base value. As the rarity increases it takes more time and effort to sell.

#### Library Scriv

#### Crafting
Item costs 50% of its maximum specified cost and also allows you to custom custom items. Each downtime turn you spend time and money on crafting the item. Each downtime turn contributes 50 GR towards the cost of an item. After you have spent enough downtime turns to cover the cost of the item, you gain the item.
#### Researching / Customising Spells (Wizard)
The usual rules apply for copying a spell from a spell scroll or a spellbook and does not require the use of downtime. 

If you wish to learn spells for which you do not have access to spell scrolls, you can perform research. Researching a spell takes 1 downtime turn and costs 75 GR per spell level.
