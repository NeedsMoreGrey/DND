# Exhaustion
*Custom rule*
While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects:  

### Exhaustion Levels
This condition is cumulative.Each time you receive this condition, you gain 1 Exhaustion level.  

### D20 Tests Affected
When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 1 times your Exhaustion level.  

### Speed Reduced
Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.  

### Removing Exhaustion Levels
Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. Extending your long rest by a day removes an additional level. 

*Example: if you had 3 levels of exhaustion you would reduce that to 2 levels of exhaustion on the 3rd day of a long rest, 1 level of exhaustion if you extended your rest to a 4th day, and no exhaustion after completing a 5th day of rest.*

### Ending Exhaustion
When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.
