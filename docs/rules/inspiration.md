# Inspiration
You can only have one inspiration at a time. You lose Inspiration when you take a short/long rest, *unless* it is the first thing done during a session. 

## Session Inspiration
You start every session with inspiration. 

## Blessed Inspiration
When you roll a natural 1, you gain Blessed Inspiration. You may add 1d4 to a roll. You can do this after the die has been rolled, but before a result has been determined by the DM.
