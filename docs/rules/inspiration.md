# Inspiration
You can only have one of each type of inspiration at a time. This means that you can have Session Inspiration and Blessed Inspiration, but you cannot have more than one Blessed Inspiration.

## Session Inspiration
You start every session with inspiration. At the end of every session, you lose your session inspiration.

## Blessed Inspiration
When you roll a natural 1, you gain Blessed Inspiration. You may add 1d4 to a roll. You can do this after the die has been rolled, but before a result has been determined by the DM. At the end of every session, you lose your blessed inspiration.
