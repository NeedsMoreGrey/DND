# Level 1 Feat
These feats have been taken directly from the new Player's Handbook (2024). You may choose any feat from this list at level 1 during character creation.

## Alert
You gain the following benefits:

**Initiative Proficiency**  
When you roll Initiative, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the roll.

**Initiative Swap**  
Immediately after you roll Initia-tive, you can swap your Initiative with the Initiative of one willing ally in the same combat. You can't make this swap if you or the ally has the Incapacitated condition.

!!! note 
    
    This replaces the feat of the same name from the Player's Handbook (2014) due to the new [initiative rule](/rules/surprise).

## Healer
You gain the following benefits:

**Battle Medic**  
If you have a Healer's Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a Utilize action. That creature can expend one of its Hit Point Dice, and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus.

**Healing Rerolls**
Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.

!!! note 
    
    This replaces the feat of the same name from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything

## Lucky
You gain the following benefits:

**Luck Points**  
You have a number of Luck Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus and can spend the points on the benefits below. You regain your expended Luck Points when you finish a Long Rest.

**Advantage**  
When you roll a d20 for a D20 Test, you can spend 1 Luck Point to give yourself Advantage on the roll.

**Disadvantage**  
When a creature rolls a d20 for an attack roll against you, you can spend 1 Luck Point to impose Disadvantage on that roll.

    This replaces the feat of the same name from the Player's Handbook (2014)

## Magic Initiate
You gain the following benefits:

**Two Cantrips**  
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells (choose when you select this feat).

**Level 1 Spell**  
Choose a level 1 spell from the same list you selected for this feat's cantrips. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

**Spell Change**  
Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with a different spell of the same level from the chosen spell list.

!!! note 
    
    This feat does **not** replace the feat of the same name from the Player's Handbook, but only this version can be taken at level 1. At subsequent levels you can choose between this version and the original version.


## Savage Attacker
You've trained to deal particularly damaging strikes. Once per turn when you hit a target with a weapon, you can roll the weapon's damage dice twice and use either roll against the target.

!!! note 
    
    If you take this feat, you will need to manage this manually as Fantasy Grounds does not support this directly. Roll the weapon damage dice in the chat twice and tell me which damage you would like to apply to the target.

## Skilled
You gain proficiency in any combination of three skills or tools of your choice.

**Repeatable**  
You can take this feat more than once.

## Tavern Brawler
You gain the following benefits:

**Enhanced Unarmed Strike**  
When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.

**Damage Rerolls**
Whenever you roll a damage die for your Unarmed Strike, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.

**Improvised Weaponry**  
You have proficiency with improvised weapons.

**Push**  
When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can deal damage to the target and also push it 5 feet away from you. You can use this benefit only once per turn.

!!! note 
    
    This replaces the feat of the same name from the Player's Handbook (2014)

## Tough
Your Hit Point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your character level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a character level thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional 2 Hit Points.
