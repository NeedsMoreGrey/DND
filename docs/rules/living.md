# Living Costs
In the last campaign I ran money was plentiful but there were few ways to spend it, so acquiring currency was rarely interesting or meaningful. During the campaign money is going to be spent on simply living, as well as various materials. 

To help root the world and to help you understand the value of the money you gain and spend, this table gives you an idea of how much each lifestyle would cost for a day and a year. It also helps me to set the amount of money people are likely to have on them more easily and the reward translates directly to player benefits.

## Spending Money
You will need to spend money as time passes. If you choose to live modestly at the Institute for a [span](/calendar) (12 days), you will need to spend 12 gp to do so. similarly, if you travel from Heresborough to Theresham and the journey takes a span (12 days), you will need to pay 24 gp to travel modestly.  

However, instead of trying to plan ahead and manage resources such as ration, you will instead pay *after* the time has been completed to save on excessive micromanaging.
