# Resting & Downtime
We will be using something close to the "Gritty realism" rules from the Dungeon Master's Guide (2014). This places new limits and restrictions on how/when you can rest.

## Long Rest
A long rest takes three (3) days and must take place in a safe location, such as a tavern, an ally's house, or other sanctuary in which you are not disturbed.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

## Short Rest
A short rest takes a minimum of six (6) hours and usually involves a meal and sleep.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

## Downtime
During a long rest, characters can use that time to conduct activities which do not require significant amount of energy. This can include things such as research, crafting items (including spell scrolls), making new contacts, gambling, religious service, or working for money.
